Vulnerability Scanning Techniques:
Vulnerability scanning is the process of identifying open ports, services, and potential weaknesses using tools like Nmap. CVSS scoring helps prioritize risks while false positives are manually validated.

Penetration Testing Techniques:
Penetration testing follows structured phases such as reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, post-exploitation, and reporting while ensuring ethical authorization and defined scope.

Exploit Development Basics:
Exploit development involves understanding vulnerabilities like SQL injection, buffer overflow, and XSS. Mitigation techniques such as patching, ASLR, and WAFs help prevent exploitation.

Remediation:
Unused ports should be disabled, regular patching should be performed, and firewall rules should be properly configured to reduce exposure.

Briefing:
The system was tested for common vulnerabilities. No critical public exposure was found, and recommendations were provided to enhance overall security posture.
